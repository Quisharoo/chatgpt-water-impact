# GitHub Link Consolidation Summary

## Problem Identified

**Before**: 6 duplicate GitHub links scattered across privacy components
- Created confusion and clutter
- Multiple "sources of truth" for the same information
- Less professional appearance
- Higher maintenance burden

## Solution Implemented

**After**: 2 clear, authoritative links (one per component)
- Single primary link in each component's most relevant section
- Cross-references guide users to the authoritative link
- Cleaner, more professional UX
- Easier to maintain

---

## Detailed Changes

### privacy-banner.tsx

**Before** (2 links):
1. ❌ "Technical Verification" → "Review the Code" box → GitHub link
2. ✅ "Open Source Transparency" section → GitHub link

**After** (1 link):
- ✅ "Open Source Transparency" section → **PRIMARY LINK**
- "Technical Verification" → References section below:
  ```
  "You can inspect the actual code in the Open Source Transparency section below."
  ```

### privacy-faq.tsx

**Before** (4 links):
1. ❌ "How can I verify" → conversation-parser.ts link
2. ❌ "How can I verify" → water-calculator.ts link  
3. ❌ "How can I verify" → Full repository link
4. ✅ "Is this application open source?" → GitHub link

**After** (1 link):
- "How can I verify" → Mentions files without links:
  ```
  "You can inspect the code that processes your files 
  (including conversation-parser.ts and water-calculator.ts) 
  on GitHub. See the 'Is this application open source?' 
  section below for the repository link."
  ```
- ✅ "Is this application open source?" → **PRIMARY LINK**
