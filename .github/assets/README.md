# Assets

This directory contains images and assets for the project README.

## Screenshots

To add the main screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of the application showing the full interface with data loaded
2. Save it as `screenshot.png` in this directory
3. Recommended size: ~1200-1600px wide for good GitHub display
4. Ensure it shows: header, upload area, stats cards, chart, and comparisons

The screenshot is referenced in the main README.md file.
